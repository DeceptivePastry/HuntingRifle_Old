Brings back the Pre-A20 Hunting rifle. This was my first time working with models in Unity, let me know if you find any issues.

- Iron sights are aligned and centered.
- Cleaned up the reload animation a bit to fit the new rifle holdtype. It's not perfect but should be decent.
- Unfortunately I couldn't get the flashlight and laser sight working using the new attachment system, so it uses the old style for now. Saves file size at least. Scopes do use the new system and properly sit on a rail now instead of randomly stuck on the top of the gun.
